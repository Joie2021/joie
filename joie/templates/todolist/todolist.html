          “Much of the stress that people feel doesn’t come from having too much to do.
           It comes from not finishing what they started. Keep it simple, and focus on what you have to do right now, 
           not on playing with your system. Before you get anything else, get organised. It will always save you time 
           and trouble and unneccessary anger. ”

          <h2>TO DO LIST</h2>
          <p>
          Do you have too much traffic in your mind? So many things going around in the brain that you feel like you are 
          just living in a whirlpool of things to do, ideas to chase, and ‘must do’ moments.
          Perhaps having a task list will start to solidify what needs to be done. Once you have got that task written down then 
          it creates a space in your thinking for you to turn your focus on how to do that task.
          So often after doing this the task feels like it is already half done.
