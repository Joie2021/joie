          <h2>Meditation</h2>
          <p>
            When we sit to meditate, we are looking after ourselves in ways that might not at first seem obvious.
             The benefits of meditation are numerous and varied, and supported by science.
              Many people start meditating to manage stress, reduce anxiety, and to cultivate peace of mind. 
              But there are thousands of studies documenting other less-known mindfulness meditation benefits, 
              which can have a positive impact on mental, physical, and emotional health.

            Music can improve mood, decrease pain and anxiety, and facilitate
            opportunities for emotional expression. Research suggests that music
            can benefit our physical and mental health in numerous ways. Music
            therapy is used by our hospice and palliative care board-certified
            music therapist to enhance conventional treatment for a variety of
            illnesses and disease processes – from anxiety, depression and
            stress, to the management of pain and enhancement of functioning
            after degenerative neurologic disorders.
