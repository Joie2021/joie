          <p>
            When you take the time to focus on the good things in your life you naturally become more positive. 
            By writing down what you are thankful for it can make you more optimistic because you are choosing to
             see more of the positivity in your life and give less power to negative emotions. While these positive 
             aspects of your life may be floating around in your subconscious, writing them down makes them more concrete and real.
